          <p>Hello, my name is Keith Hemsoth. I am currently working for Cleveland Communications, Inc. We are
            contracted through First Energy Nuclear to install, maintain and repair outdoor warning sirens for the
            Perry, Davis Besse, and Beaver Valley nuclear plants.</p>

          <p>After obtaining an Associates of Applied Science in Electronic Engineering Technology, I have worked in
            the field for a few years. I quickly came to realize that it was not what I was passionate about. I felt
            like working on electronics was more of a hobby that I would like to have, rather than a career.</p>

          <p>This is when I decided to look into being a developer. I have always had an interest in coding, and have
            spent some time here and there dabbling in coding. However, I never set aside time everyday to really learn
            how to code. After making the conscious decision to spend time each day learning, I knew that is what I
            wanted to do.</p>

          <p>Currently, I am enrolled in a full-stack web development bootcamp at Case Western Reserve University, and
            am loving every minute. It may be fast paced, but the information that we are learning is fascinating to
            me.</p>

          <p>As for the future, I am leaning toward focusing on the back-end of web development, however, that could
            easily change down the road. Either way, I am very excited about my future and am looking forward to
            learning as much as I can about web development.</p>
